  <h1>My Arcane Timeline</h1>
  
  <h3>Setting</h3>
  <hr> 
  <p class="poo">After Vikter was actually successful in accomplishing his glorious evolution, (Ekko falled :c), much of Piltover and Zaun was evolved. Except, instead of becoming the same soldier-like forms that was Ambessa's army, they still kept a bit of themselves, each individually unique based on a person's characteristics and personality. Viktor went back to zaun with evolved Jayce to keep trying to improve the nation that he now rules. <br> Uriel was a pilty that had origins from Zaun, much like Vikter. He grew up with kat & was often protected by them in the past. But as Uriel strove for more in the glistening buildings of Piltover. Kat didn't see the same vision. Thinking ill of Piltover like evenyone else, and rightfully so.
