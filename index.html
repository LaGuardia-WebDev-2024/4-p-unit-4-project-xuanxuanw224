  <hr class="bookends"> 
  <p class="poo">After Vikter was actually successful in accomplishing his glorious evolution, (Ekko failed :c), much of Piltover and Zaun became evolved. Except, instead of becoming the same soldier-like forms that was Ambessa's army, they still kept a bit of themselves, each individually unique based on a person's characteristics and personality. Viktor went back to zaun with evolved Jayce to keep trying to improve the nation that he now rules. <br> Uriel was a pilty that had origins from Zaun, much like Vikter. He grew up with kat & was often protected by them in the past. But as Uriel strove for more in the glistening buildings of Piltover. Kat didn't see the same vision. Thinking ill of Piltover like almost every other zaunite, and rightfully so.

  <h3 class="muffin">Story</h3>
  <hr class="bookends">
  <p class="poo">Deep underground in the remote ruins of Zaun was a forge, a secret hideout for one who didn’t want to be found. The wild foliage breathed and the river of sewage pumped. Kat eventually came to believe it was the only place left in Zaun that hadn’t been tainted by that damned herald. They were the only survivor. High above in the overrun streets of piltover bustled a serene crowd of the evolved. People- or so they seem at least, carried on with their lives in peace as if nothing had happened at all. Uriel leapt through the buildings in newfound freedom, freedom from the herald he so wished to meet. His savior. 

	The wind combed through Uriel’s hair which he was glad survived the transformation. However pleased he was with his new form, infinitely more durable and all, he hoped to not lose his favorite feature. It wasn’t hard for him to get used to it at all; his pale skin was replaced by a ceramic like glaze, and his old unimpressive form touched up to a doll-like figure, similar to the other evolved individuals. His body became adorned with the gold and pastel patterns of the anomaly, the colors were dazzling. What he loved the most, and what was unique to him, was the mysterious plants that sprouted from his body. He needed to sit down and study them as soon as he had a chance. 

	But he hasn’t had a chance, not a single breath of free time relapsed for him since the glorious evolution happened not long ago. Not a single moment passed where he wasn’t moving, running to find his best friend that he’d foolishly left behind. 

	Drip “Uriel doesn’t make mistakes.” drip “He’s too reasonable for his own good.” drip “For my own good…” drip
