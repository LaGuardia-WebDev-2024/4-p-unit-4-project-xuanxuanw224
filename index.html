  <p class="poo">After Vikter was actually successful in accomplishing his glorious evolution, (Ekko failed :c), much of Piltover and Zaun became evolved. Except, instead of becoming the same soldier-like forms that was Ambessa's army, they still kept a bit of themselves, each individually unique based on a person's characteristics and personality. Viktor went back to zaun with evolved Jayce to keep trying to improve the nation that he basically now rules. <br> Uriel was a pilty that had origins from Zaun, much like Vikter. He grew up with kat & was often protected by them in the past. But as Uriel strove for more in the glistening buildings of Piltover, Kat didn't see the same vision. She thought ill of Piltover like almost every other zaunite, and rightfully so.

          <td id="down"> Uriel: Traveled to Piltover for an education in the arts and medicine, aiming to become a herbalist that can cure the rampant diseases in Zaun caused by the horrible air quality. Perhaps a soothing tea of sorts. When he first caught wind of Vikter evolving people he was super on board with the idea, and I guess he still is. He hated shimmer. Even though he wasn't able do visit Viktor's commune because travel across the bridge was near impossible, he welcomed the transfermaton when it did occur, leaving most of his inner self intact.

            Kat: She was orphaned at a young age and lived in the same group along with Uriel. As they aged she found peace in her strength, being the brawn to Uriel's brains. After a few left turns Kat became dependent on shimmer, which both helped and ruined her. She was able to mutate animalistic features that helped her become stronger. However, their addiction began slowly impacting her health, both mentally and physically. She was working at the forge when they heard of the herald's plan to evolve the world. She immediately fled deep underground where ther Herald couldn't reach. Afraid of losing herself. </td>

  <h3 class="muffin">Story</h3>
  <hr class="bookends">
  <p class="poo">
Deep underground in the remote ruins of Zaun was a fraying sign of life, a secret hideout for one who didn’t want to be found. The vents all throughout hummed and the river of sewage pumped. Kat eventually came to believe it was the only place left in Zaun that hadn’t been tainted by that damned herald. They were the only survivor. High above in the overrun streets of piltover bustled a serene crowd of the evolved. People- or so they seem at least, carried on with their lives in peace as if nothing had happened at all. Uriel leapt through the buildings in newfound freedom, freedom from the herald he so wished to meet. His savior. 
<br>
	The wind combed through Uriel’s hair which he was glad survived the transformation. However pleased he was with his new form, infinitely more durable and all, he hoped to not lose his favorite feature. It wasn’t hard for him to get used to it at all; his pale skin was replaced by a ceramic like glaze, and his old unimpressive form touched up to a doll-like figure, similar to the other evolved individuals. His body became adorned with the gold and pastel patterns of the anomaly, the colors were dazzling. What he loved the most, and what was unique to him, was the mysterious plants that sprouted from his body. He needed to sit down and study them as soon as he had a chance. <br>
	But he hasn’t had a chance, not a single breath of free time relapsed for him since the glorious evolution took place. Not a single moment passed where he wasn’t moving, running to find his best friend that he’d foolishly left behind. 
<br>
	Drip “Uriel doesn’t make mistakes.” drip “He’s too damn smart for his own good.” drip “For my own good…” drip. Kat flexed their aching muscles that were sore not from the backbreaking work she was used to, but now from the lack thereof. Her only exercise now was avoiding the suspicious water that leaked from the ceiling. It’d been two weeks since she’d fled from her home on the surface into the tunnels of drainage, desperate to escape the apocalypse. She counted the days, today marked exactly two years since Uriel said he’d come find her, promised he’d come back for her. There was a sinking feeling in their heart each time his face flashed in her mind, her breathing strained trying to divert her mind. <br>
Of course Kat didn’t want him to leave. They contemplated forcing him to stay, what could he have done to stop her? But of course studying his little plants in sparkly Piltover came before her. With an irritated groan she tossed around on the cold floor trying to silence her mind for the 100th time that day. Her foot tapped the pile of empty shimmer vials that clinked against each other, the melody soothed her. The glowing purple fluid was the only thing illuminating the otherwise damp shadows of the tunnel; she was lucky to have found an entire crate stashed away. It was the only thing keeping her alive. Slowly, she sat up, and poured the last of the fluid down her throat before she collapsed in the darkness, onto her everspanning bed of concrete. 
<br>
“Kat?” A voice cut through the darkness. “Kat- is that you?” Nimbly the slim figure approached, carefully stepping over the various items strawn about haphazardly. Uriel’s knees quickly met the ground besides Kat’s body as he shakily checked for a pulse; but his new body hardly felt anything at all. Before his mind could spiral into contemplating if their body was even warm at all, a gloved hand shot out to meet his “Speak before I break your wrist.” A disgruntled voice threatened. 
Whenever Uriel thought of Kat, —which may or may not be more than he’d bear to admit— he saw a strong person that’d always protected him. She was much braver. When his bullies crushed a plant he’d nurtured from just a seedling, she threw an entire bush at them. Though he had to reproach her for killing the bush, he felt thankful for whatever good deed he’d done to deserve her. <br>
“Kat it’s me-” he started before he was cut off, “Uriel.” Kat finished.
