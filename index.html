  <p class="poo">After Vikter carried out the glorious evolution, upon Ekko's failure, Piltover and Zaun were successfully evolved. Except, instead of becoming the same soldier-like forms that was Ambessa's army, they still kept a bit of themselves. Each individual was still unique based on their characteristics and personality. Viktor went back to Zaun with evolved Jayce to keep trying to improve the nation that he basically now ruled. <br> Uriel was a pilty that had origins from Zaun, much like Vikter. He grew up with kat & was often protected by them in the past. But as Uriel strove for more in the glistening buildings of Piltover, Kat didn't see the same vision. She thought ill of Piltover like almost every other zaunite, and rightfully so.

Even though he wasn't able do visit Viktor's commune because travel across the bridge was near impossible, he welcomed the transfermaton when it did occur, leaving most of his inner self intact.

            Kat: She was orphaned at a young age and lived in the same group home as Uriel. As they aged she found peace in her strength, being the brawn to Uriel's brains. After a few left turns Kat became dependent on shimmer, which both helped and ruined her. She was able to mutate animalistic features that helped her in all sorts of ways. However, their addiction also began slowly impacting her health, both mentally and physically. She was working at the forge when they overheard of the herald's plan to evolve the world. She immediately fled deep underground where the anomoly couldn't reach, afraid of losing herself. </td>

					<strong>In Our Timeline </strong>
<br><br>
					     Cindy Wu
<br><br>
Deep underground in the pipes of Zaun was a fraying sign of life, a secret hideout for one who didn’t want to be found. The vents all throughout hummed and the river of sewage flowed. Kat eventually came to believe it was the only place left in Zaun that hadn’t been tainted by that damned herald. They were the only survivor. High above in the overgrown streets of Piltover bustled a serene crowd of the evolved. People- or so they still seemed at least, carried on with their lives in peace as if nothing had happened at all. Uriel leapt through the buildings in newfound freedom, freedom from the herald he so wished to meet. His savior. 
<br><br>
	The wind combed through Uriel’s hair which he was glad survived the transformation. However pleased he was with his new form, infinitely more durable and all, he hoped to not lose his favorite feature. It wasn’t hard for him to get used to it at all; his pale skin was replaced by a ceramic like glaze, and his old unimpressive form touched up to a doll-like figure; similar to the other evolved individuals. His body also became adorned with the gold and pastel patterns of the anomaly, the colors were dazzling. 
<br><br>
What he loved the most though, and what was unique to him, was the mysterious plants that sprouted from his body. He spent his four years in the top university of Piltover studying herbs to find a cure for Shimmer poisoning and the Zaun Gray that plagued his home. Even though the glorious evolution had solved both of those problems for him in the blink of an eye, he still longed to sit down and study them as soon as he had the chance. 
<br><br>
	But he hasn’t had a chance, not a single breath of free time relapsed for him since the glorious evolution took place. Not a single moment passed where he wasn’t moving, running to find his best friend that he’d foolishly left behind. 
<br><br>
	<em>Drip</em> “Uriel doesn’t make mistakes.” <em>drip</em> “He’s too damn smart for his own good.” <em>drip</em> “For my own good…” <em>drip</em>. Kat flexed their aching muscles that were numbly sore, not from the backbreaking work she’d gotten used to, but from the lack thereof. Her only exercise now was avoiding the suspicious water that leaked from the cracked curvature of the ceiling. Of course Kat didn’t want him to leave. They’d contemplated forcing him to stay, what could he have done to stop her? But of course studying his little plants in sparkly Piltover came before her.
<br><br>
There was a sinking feeling in their heart each time his face flashed in her mind. Her breathing strained as she tried to divert her mind. 
<br><br>
 It’d been two weeks since she’d fled from her home in Zaun into the tunnels of drainage, desperate to escape the apocalypse. And counting the days, today marked exactly four years since Uriel said he’d come find her, promised he’d come back for her. With an irritated groan she tossed around on the cold floor trying to silence her mind for the 100th time that day, she hated the cold. Her foot tapped the pile of empty shimmer vials, making them clink against each other. The melody soothed her. 
<br><br>
The glowing purple fluid was the only thing illuminating the otherwise damp shadows of the tunnel; she was lucky to have found an entire crate stashed away. It was the only thing keeping her alive. Slowly, she sat up, and poured the last of the fluid down her throat before she collapsed in the darkness, onto her everspanning grey bed of concrete. 
<br><br>
“Kat?” A voice cut through the darkness. “Kat- is that you?” Nimbly the slim figure approached, carefully stepping over the various items strawn about haphazardly. Uriel’s knees quickly met the ground besides the lifeless body as he shakily checked for a pulse; but his porcelain body hardly felt anything at all. Before his mind could spiral into contemplating if her body was even warm at all, a gloved hand shot out to meet his. 
<br><br>
“Speak before I break your wrist.” A disgruntled voice threatened. 
<br><br>
Whenever Uriel thought of Kat, —which may or may not be more than he’d bear to admit— he saw a beacon, a safe place to retreat to at any time. He’d never questioned before if he’d taken it for granted. When his bullies crushed a plant he’d nurtured from just a seedling, she threw an entire bush at them. Though he had to reproach her for killing the bush, he felt thankful for whatever good deed he’d done to deserve her. 
<br><br>
“Kat it’s me-” he started before he was cut off, “Uriel.” Kat finished abruptly. She only loosened her grip slightly; but it pivoted from a punishing clutch to a somewhat desperate hold. “Uriel.” She tried again, stifling any doubt in their mind. “Kat what could you possibly be-” Uriel stopped mid-sentence with a gasp as Kat lunged at him and pulled him in a hug. Maybe it was their adrenaline that kept her from noticing how his flesh felt like glass, or her impaired vision that left his lack of clothing unrecognized. “How did you survive… I thought I’d lost you up there.” Kat mumbled, she spoke out loud to herself rather than expecting an answer. Uriel felt a painful sting in his chest. 
<br><br>
“Kat, I- why are you down here!?” Uriel finally exclaimed. “Ah nevermind that, I’m so glad you’re still yourself. Come with me, I know the way out.” Uriel stood, almost taking Kat with him had she not let go. “I was so worried you wouldn’t hold up well with the transformation, I'm just so relieved.” He continued. 
<br><br>
<em>Drip</em> 
<br><br>
“Kat?”  
<br><br>
Uriel flinched as Kat broke into a coughing fit. A few beats passed before she threw up a puddle of fluorescent liquid that Uriel knew too well. Shimmer. The moist surfaces of the tunnel reflected the light, revealing the figures standing on either side. Uriel gagged at the sight. 
<br><br>
	Kat would never admit it, but Uriel lived in her mind rent free. She never really liked playing with dolls when they were a girl, which made all the more sense when they realized they weren’t exactly a girl in the first place. But Uriel was an exception. They pictured his perfect features, how his thin fingers wrote down perfect cursive for her homework that later got her in trouble. Truly a treasure to be protected. 
<br><br>
	Her treasure, her treasure she kept safe for so long. She looked up to see the thing that wasn’t the familiar man she knew at all. Where was he? 
<br><br>
	“What happened to you?” They harmonized in unison. 
<br><br>
	Neither dared to break the silence that followed, as if straining to decipher any meaning in the other’s shallow breaths. Kat slowly began to back up until her back reached the far wall. Uriel matched them with a few steps forward “Kat it’s okay, you’ll be okay.” He reassured the cornered figure, “I can evolve you. Right now. You won’t have to hurt anymore, just make sure not to resist, okay?” 
<br><br>
	“What have they done to you?” Kat whispered, clenched fists shaking “The monsters.” 
	<br><br>
	He reached his fingers forward towards their forehead, “Kat I don’t understand, look how I’ve improved-” 
<br><br>
	“I don’t recommend you come closer.” A violet glow emitted from her eyes, though only momentarily before she fell to the ground, panting. 
<br><br>
	“You’re sick.” Uriel observed. 
<br><br>
	“Thanks Sherlock.” 
<br><br>
	Each gesture Uriel made to help was promptly rejected, though it was hard enough to help while not looking at each other. Eventually, Uriel left for food and water. Kat took advantage of the time to finally rest her head that she’s been expanding all her energy keeping up until now. She knew he wasn’t the Uriel she knew anymore, but how could she ever mistake the beautiful tufts of caramel that cascaded down his shoulders. She loved his hair. As they laid there, sprawled out in the dark, they imagined Uriel never returning after seeing the pathetic display she was reduced to. 
<br><br>
	“Hell if I care…” She cursed. 
<br><br>
Their vision began to subside again as their puddle of Shimmer-filled puke began to dry. She edged towards it, considering if it was worth salvaging, just to feel the high of Shimmer once more. It was almost entirely shimmer that she threw up, she’s built up an unfortunate tolerance to the thing. The idea made her sick. 
<br><br>
	Uriel came back with a basket of food and several canteens of clean water. His calls from the darkness gave Kat a strange sense of deja vu, she hoped she wouldn’t have to get used to it. Uriel ripped the bread into bite sized chunks and brought them to Kat’s mouth without a word. Both of them kept their eyes open, staring straight ahead. They both imagined a detailed version of the other in the absence of light. Uriel, a beautiful young man, freckles dusted like stars on his soft skin, chestnut eyes and dimples on either side of his hollow cheeks. Kat, still confident and full of fire, no trace of shimmer but with new features of the evolved. 
<br><br>
Uriel spent his time away thinking. He couldn’t conjure up a single reason why she was being so difficult. If she just let him help, the same way the herald helped him, they would be happy again. Together again. 
<br><br>
Days passed with the same routine. By the end of the week Kat was curled up on the ground with her back to Uriel while barely swallowing any food. 
<br><br>
“You need sunlight Kat, how long do you think you can keep being stubborn?” Uriel asked rhetorically. 
<br><br>
“I’d lose you in the light.” 
<br><br>
Kat’s days became a blur of dream and reality. It didn’t make a difference to the dark whether or not they opened their eyes, but they always kept them pointed towards Uriel’s voice, always imagining. Uriel spent his time beside her anytime he wasn’t getting more supplies, catching them up on his life away from home. They responded with nods that went unnoticed. 
<br><br>
Through it all, Kat discovered their fondness for dreams; she was just a teenager again, sitting on the rooftops with the Uriel she loved. She would poke fun at his fear of heights while secretly making sure he never lost his balance. 
She woke up with her head resting on his shoulder. Uriel stirred, noticing her movement, his chest began to rise and fall steadily. It was a bitter reminder for Kat that he wasn’t human anymore, but a machine that didn’t need to sleep, or even breathe if not reminded to. Slowly she repositioned herself to the ground. 
<br><br>
“What’s wrong?” 
<br><br>
“It’s nothing… Uriel.” She sighed. She felt weaker than the rats that would visit them for the leftover crumbs every so often. Uriel had shooed them away, he didn’t want to encourage them and end up attracting a hoard. 
<br><br>
“Kat you’re experiencing withdrawals from shimmer, you’ve eaten less and less, you need to let me evolve you now.” Uriel suddenly pressed. Kat stayed silent. He moved his body until he was next to her head, and used his palm to caress her cheek. A pointless gesture from him. 
<br><br>
“You're cold.” Kat complained without much force.
<br><br>
Uriel’s fingers traced the outline of her face, stopping when the tips met her forehead. “Please don’t resist.” Uriel said steadily. 
<br><br>
“Leave me.” Kat sighed, closing her eyes.  
<br><br>
“This is our timeline Kat, this one and every other timeline is ours.” He insisted, voice rising in urgency. 
<br><br>
“You’ve left me before,” She said. 
<br><br>
“I’m sorry.” He croaked out.
<br><br>
“Maybe we were never destined for a happy ending in our timeline.” She concluded, closing her eyes.
<br><br>
“Please let me try.” 
<br><br>
	Starting as a faint glow, a burst of light traveled through Uriel’s fingers into Kat. A beam of light shot from her eyes and all around them, engulfing the small crevice of the tunnel. After the dust settled, the two sat in the deafening silence, without a single breath to be heard.
